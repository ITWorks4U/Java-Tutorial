# Inchesstigated

The game chess written in Java 8 (+ Java Swing) for the module "WW1" in 2019 of the Hochschule Mittweida - University of Applied Sciences.
In this game you can play the game chess, where its content is basic, which means, there is no AI or a network interface. There was not enough time to implement such features.
